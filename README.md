Hi everyone!

This grocery store management system is my first Python coding project.<br>
(Psst: It was a university group project but I secretly code everything by myself during my mid-semester break back then >.<).

The project is considered a simple one <i>(where I have no idea about any coding practices, everything was coded based on my own logic)</i>. It runs via the CLI and no GUI is involved.

All information are stored in text files, where you can find the usernames and passwords in `username.txt`, while the item details are stored in `inventory.txt`.

It was memorable looking back at my first project and uploading it to GitHub for the purpose of archiving it.

Do try to clone this repository and play around with the system. Have fun!
